## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- NPM
- MongoDB

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:
npm install

DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-db
SESSION_SECRET=your-secret
API_KEY=your-api-key-for-football-data

4. Run the server using:
5. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser to access the application.

## Configuration

The application requires the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

- `DATABASE_URL`: Connection string for the MongoDB database.
- `SESSION_SECRET`: A secret key for session hashing to enhance security.
- `API_KEY`: An API key for accessing football data (you can specify the provider and how to obtain this key).
